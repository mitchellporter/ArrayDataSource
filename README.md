# ArrayDataSource
Swift implementation of Objc.io's ArrayDataSource class

This is a Swift implementation of the ArrayDataSource class that was created for the first part of Objc.io Issue #1 - Lighter View Controllers: https://www.objc.io/issues/1-view-controllers/lighter-view-controllers/

The specific class file can be found here: https://github.com/objcio/issue-1-lighter-view-controllers/blob/master/PhotoData/ArrayDataSource.m

I converted this class to Swift because I'm trying to get better at building better models and relying on controllers less.
